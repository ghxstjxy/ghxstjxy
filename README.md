### **GET TO KNOW ME ! ü™º**

‚ú≠ * My name's Jay but you can call me whatever you want! **I'm a big fan of nicknames** ÔΩ°Àö

Í©ú Most of the time I'm down to chat, but I'll let you know if otherwise. I'm always C+H but when around friends please ask! I'm not a very empathetic person and I'm autistic so I might say something that you don't agree with, or show uninterest in something. I'm also a very blunt person and won't sugarcoat anything, if something bothers me, I will tell you. I block freely and will not accept friend requests easily, it's called a **friends** list for a reason.

Í©ú I can be very energetic at times, especially talking about interests and special interests! I'll try to mask my energy but it can take over very easily ...

Í©ú I am part of the **LGBT community**, I ship characters a lot (mainly gay ships) and I don't believe in god, if you don't like that, **get out**. I won't tolerate any disrespect because of who I or my friends are.

‚úß I love anime, youtube series, movies and tv shows! My favourite movie is How To Train Your Dragon and my favourite youtube series is the life series! My most favourite shows are Bungo Stray Dogs and Toilet-Bound Hanako-Kun. Most favourite characters are Mitsuba (not sousuke.) and Rina! I also watch vtubers and my kamioshis are Rosemi and Camila! I like pink-haired characters a lot ...

‚úß I also love manga, webcomics and books! My favourite book is The Sunbearer Trials, I have too many favourite webcomics and my favourite manga is a tie between The Summer Hikaru Died and The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn't A Guy At All (aka green yuri)

‚úß I'm also a big fan of music! I studied it in highschool and carry my wireless headphones with me EVERYWHERE. My favourite song is Ado's cover of Crime And Punishment! Ado is also my favourite artist!! I love music a lot, give me any song reccs, I listen to all genres!

You can probably tell by my spelling of "favourite" that I am a tea drinker ... I am so sorry I was born and raised in England ... If you don't support this, it's okay, I understand...

Í©ú I don't have much DNI, just don't be a bigot or an asshole and I won't really care! Also anyone who my friends dont like, immediate DNI, I do not care about your side of the story. 

Í©ú INT if you want! or not! up to you! I crown skins that I recognise and don't mind being whispered! Like I said, I'm always down to chat! In my opinion I'm quite silly and I'll match your energy if I'm awake enough lmao

Í©ú For the purpose of other peoples boundaries I am 18 years old

Í©ú That's all I can think of! Click the links in my profile for more detail in my interests or specific details about me!
